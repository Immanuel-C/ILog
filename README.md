# ILog
The ILog is for people who need a simple logger. **Currently for windows and linux only.**
This logger is for C/C++.

This repo is under the MIT license, so you can modify this as much as you want and repost the code.

IC_DEBUG_* is for debug builds only while IC_* is for all builds.

To format things you can use the regular printf format options. (e.g. %p for a pointer, %d for numbers, etc.). 

# Issues
